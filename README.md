Binusmaya forum grabber and journal

wfhsucks if a "program" i made to help me deal with stuff like
- checking all forum for new threads easily
- checking all courses for new video conference schedules
- finishing all my forum assignments
- not having to deal with bimay's loading speed
- not missing video conferences

using it alone feels like a waste tho, so here ya go, hope it helps
stay safe
