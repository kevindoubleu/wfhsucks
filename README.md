# wfhsucks

Tired of bimay's forum interface? 
Lot's of repetitive clicking?
Can't remember which forums tasks and discussions you've done?
This looks familiar?

Well how about a script that solves all that?
All the forums are fetched automatically with 1 button press.
Only essential data is loaded, which means more speed!
No need to load already loaded data as it is saved locally, more speed and "offline" access!
Keeping track of replying to forums is much easier with a "todo list" style of approach.

Binusmaya forum grabber and journal

wfhsucks if a "program" i made to help me deal with stuff like
- checking all forum for new threads easily
- checking all courses for new video conference schedules
- finishing all my forum assignments
- not having to deal with bimay's loading speed
- not missing video conferences

using it alone feels like a waste tho, so here ya go, hope it helps
stay safe

any improvements are welcome
